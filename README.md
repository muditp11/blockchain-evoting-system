# blockchain-E-voting-system

This repository includes an exhaustive literature review and comparative study of various blockchain-based electronic voting systems. The main aim of this project is to compare the existing research papers based on their methodologies, system design, consensus algorithms, security, and scalability models.

The aim of this project is to understand the possibilities of using blockchain technology to improve transparency, security, and trustworthiness of electronic voting systems. Instead of designing a new system, this project critically evaluates the existing systems and their limitations, along with the possibilities of improvement.

This project has been submitted as part of the Project-Based Learning (PBL) course.
